## Python syntax
Checked: 45 files
Result: PASS

## Scope note
The native SDK/build pipeline no longer uses vendor MRE headers or static libraries. A VXP application still necessarily relies on the target device firmware ABI for OS services such as display, input, timer, files, audio and resource loading.

The bundled exact-VXP emulator remains an optional desktop testing component; it is not required to compile the LuaS30 Native SDK/runtime.
